## **youTube-comments-Analyzer**
**Project Goal: ** Develop a tool (youTube-comments-Analyzer) to analyze and understand the sentiment, topics, and engagement of comments on YouTube videos.
### **Functionalities:**
•	Data Collection:
o	Users can specify a YouTube video URL.
o	The tool can collect comments from the video using either a safe method (manual copy-paste) or a more automated method requiring caution (web scraping with adherence to YouTube's terms of service).
o	The YouTube Data API (preferred method) can be integrated for programmatic comment retrieval, requiring some technical setup.
•	Data Preprocessing:
o	Cleaning the comments by removing irrelevant information like emojis, punctuation, and excessive whitespace.
o	Standardizing text by converting everything to lowercase and potentially stemming or lemmatization (converting words to their root form).
•	Analysis:
o	Sentiment analysis: Classifying comments as positive, negative, or neutral to understand the overall viewer reception of the video.
	Utilize sentiment analysis APIs like Google Cloud Natural Language API or Amazon Comprehend.
o	Topic modeling: Identifying the most frequent topics discussed in the comments to understand what aspects of the video resonate with viewers.
	Utilize NLP libraries like spaCy or Gensim for topic modeling techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
o	Engagement metrics: Analyzing the number of likes, dislikes, and replies for each comment to identify the most engaging comments and potential discussion threads.
•	Visualization:
o	Present the findings through charts and graphs for easier interpretation.
	Using Plotly for visualizations like sentiment distribution charts, word clouds for prominent topics, and bar charts for engagement metrics.
	Creating an Interactive Dashboard on Streamlit 
Benefits:
•	Content creators: Gain valuable insights into audience reception, identify popular topics for future content, and understand how to improve audience engagement.
•	Marketers: Analyze audience sentiment towards brands or products showcased in videos.
•	Researchers: Study online communities and public opinion on specific topics through YouTube comments.
Project Deliverables:
•	A functional youTube-comments-Analyzer tool (Streamlit Application/Interactive Dashboard)
•	Documentation explaining the functionalities, technical aspects, and usage instructions.
