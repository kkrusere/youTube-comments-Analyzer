        "\n",
        "5. **Language-Specific Processing**:\n",

That should be enough to completely abolish it, considering all the support for it is motivated by anger over people unjustly killed. But in case it’s not enough for you for some reason, it’s also on average twice as expensive to enforce it on a convict than life in prison without parole is. This is due to the appeals court process, which typically takes around a decade or more. So enforcing the death penalty on people means way more of our tax dollars are being spent on horrible people than necessary. The literal only reason to keep this policy around is a primitive desire for vengeance as well as valuing an emotional response over a practical one. It’s kinda funny that conservatives constantly tout a “facts over feelings” mentality, yet they are the most gung ho about maintaining the death penalty, and in many cases support increasing its hold over the American justice system. The most emotionally driven policy in existence, considering it is nothing but a practical liability.

Secondly, research is ongoing for new battery technologies and mining with BEV, if the whole chain of producing a battery was CO2 neutral then the initial emissions would also be lower and third the production of \"green\" gasoline would require vast amounts of crop fields that cover the entire earth to produce enough ethanol to satisfy the whole fleet of ICE vehicles. So it's a complex problem, but BEV is the way to go together with replacing our old coal/oil/gas powerplants with renewables and nuclear.

I don't think we need to add up more negativity to it, but instead work on making people understand why it was a bad thing to do, at least from some point of view. And last but not least, I simply consider life too precious to be ended, even the most brutal and terrible people still SHOULD deserve acceptance, love, respect.

            "Even in nature being promiscuous can be a good strategy for women. Not as much as men but especially when multiple offspring can be produced a lot of female organisms will not want to hedge their bets on one male. For example if you look at a lot of cat and dog litters you will see a mix because the ovum are not released at the same time so they can be fertilized by a different male. Having a diversity of genetics is an a good strategy because it helps protect against diseases and variable environmental changes. Ovum and producing organisms is often expensive for females (but is not always the limiting factor like sea horses for example) so it makes a lot of sense for female organisms to not put all their eggs in one basket if they can. This is why rural male cats will often have mate guarding behaviors and succeed in places where they can use such strategies. Other male cats don’t mate guard and instead couple with as many females as possible. This can be more successful in densely populated areas like cities. \n",

Sexual selection often is much stronger than natural selection since it is not the individual that really participates in these things but populations. It’s also much more dynamic and complex. You have competition between and within the sexes but also cooperation between sexes and within sexes, often at the same time! Social animals make things even more complicated because social groups can learn and be effected by shared learned behaviors. Additionally individuals, especially as animals become more intelligent are not really robots mindlessly following the demands of evolution. It’s a lot more like hardware (evolution) with the software from individual experience and development acting in concert with that. It can vary from organism to organism, from one behavior to another and is subject to the environment which is often in flux.\n",

            "The main mistake that has occurred is we have taken one extreme to the other. I dated men who said it's not gonna be a choice you're gonna be the homemaker and I was like well what am I going to do before we have kids? And they would be shocked and say well I guess you'll be cleaning the house. That wasn't going to work for me and I wasn't okay with that. The husband I married supports me In the fact that when we got married I wanted to work. Went to school, found a job I loved, and supported me when I said I want to keep working when we have kids. He also supported me and said we have the money to do so and I will get a raise when I said it is so much money to pay for day care that I think it's time to let me just be a stay at home mom. That's the difference. My husband encourages the choices that I make but also supports when it came time to support our family. He never undermines my contribution to the family roll and considers what I do a full-time job like his. We also are still a team when it comes to being parents together. A good example is my husband came home and I had dinner made and while I bathed the kids, he did the dishes and while he read books I moved the laundry around. So we are doing what I think feminist would throw a big fit over nowadays but it is different from the past because there is a mutual understanding that this isn't based on gender this is based on being a team and this is what works for our family. Feminist have lost sight of being viewed as equals but mainly focus on men are worthless and anyone doing what makes them happy with a man who shows them respect is putting their efforts in the trash. I would say what they are doing is actually causing the original goal being thrown in the trash., \n",

My interest is personal as I flew on Concorde 4 times and always considered it to be not only the most incredible passenger aircraft of all time but also the safest. So when I learned here that it had a history of tyre failure and fuel tank rupture I was shocked. Combined with the maintenance failure by Airfrance, and the same with the DC10, it left me totally dismayed that such negligence could be possible with passenger aircraft. My flights were with BA so maybe their maintenance was to a higher standard than Airfrance but that still leaves the tyre failure issue as a major concern. I was very sad when this accident occurred, more so now I realise it was totally avoidable, and the loss of Concorde is disappointing but maybe a good thing considering what we see in this vid, as it seems this accident could have occurred at any time, with an even greater loss of life.

That should be enough to completely abolish it, considering all the support for it is motivated by anger over people unjustly killed. But in case it’s not enough for you for some reason, it’s also on average twice as expensive to enforce it on a convict than life in prison without parole is. This is due to the appeals court process, which typically takes around a decade or more. So enforcing the death penalty on people means way more of our tax dollars are being spent on horrible people than necessary. The literal only reason to keep this policy around is a primitive desire for vengeance as well as valuing an emotional response over a practical one. It’s kinda funny that conservatives constantly tout a “facts over feelings” mentality, yet they are the most gung ho about maintaining the death penalty, and in many cases support increasing its hold over the American justice system. The most emotionally driven policy in existence, considering it is nothing but a practical liability.

Secondly, research is ongoing for new battery technologies and mining with BEV, if the whole chain of producing a battery was CO2 neutral then the initial emissions would also be lower and third the production of \"green\" gasoline would require vast amounts of crop fields that cover the entire earth to produce enough ethanol to satisfy the whole fleet of ICE vehicles. So it's a complex problem, but BEV is the way to go together with replacing our old coal/oil/gas powerplants with renewables and nuclear.

God is good because He gives His blessings to everyone, whether they be good or bad. but everyone has at least, told a lie, or stolen something in their life. and that makes them sinners, and God will not allow sin to enter heaven; into His presence, because He is holy. so, God has to punish the sinners in hell, because God is severe, wrathful and just. but God is also loving and merciful. so, all of God's attributes, His goodness, holiness, justice, severity/wrath, plus His love and mercy, must all work together in harmony, without one attribute negating or lessening another. that's why Jesus Christ, who is fully man and fully God, and lived a sinless life, was found worthy to be sacrificed on the cross for our sakes (because paying for our own sins means an eternity in hell). and here are the steps to receiving this gift; to be saved: \r\n",

I don't think we need to add up more negativity to it, but instead work on making people understand why it was a bad thing to do, at least from some point of view.

Not as much as men but especially when multiple offspring can be produced a lot of female organisms will not want to hedge their bets on one male. For example if you look at a lot of cat and dog litters you will see a mix because the ovum are not released at the same time so they can be fertilized by a different male. Having a diversity of genetics is an a good strategy because it helps protect against diseases and variable environmental changes. Ovum and producing organisms is often expensive for females (but is not always the limiting factor like sea horses for example) so it makes a lot of sense for female organisms to not put all their eggs in one basket if they can. This is why rural male cats will often have mate guarding behaviors and succeed in places where they can use such strategies. Other male cats don’t mate guard and instead couple with as many females as possible. This can be more successful in densely populated areas like cities. \n",

You have competition between and within the sexes but also cooperation between sexes and within sexes, often at the same time! Social animals make things even more complicated because social groups can learn and be effected by shared learned behaviors. Additionally individuals, especially as animals become more intelligent are not really robots mindlessly following the demands of evolution. It’s a lot more like hardware (evolution) with the software from individual experience and development acting in concert with that. It can vary from organism to organism, from one behavior to another and is subject to the environment which is often in flux.\n",

Off-grid solar / battery power supplies with a dedicated system to charge the car being constructed by yours truly right now.100km from the shops with a car that has 300km of range if I drive like grandma. Not much over 80 kph increase consumption by 20%. I charge at home on 10 amps which takes nearly two days at the moment if the car battery is low. It's a Hundai Kona and I don't like the pseudo safety features like active driver assistance for collision avoidance and lane keeping, etc., which have to be switched off again every time the car is parked and re-started. Can't be stores in driver I.D. and the collision avoidance active assist is a death trap on our narrow roads which have many B double quarry trucks taking up more than half the other lane. And there are drop offs on one side and embankments on the other - the last thing you want is some moronic robot trying to steer you over a cliff because the other car is too close ..... Oh yes - if I charge the car in town on the 25 kva fast charger, I take the Valk e-scooter out and do my shopping, etc., while the car is on charge - the scooter gets around fast enough for long enough to do most of my calls in about 80mins for a full charge.

It took me 90 seconds to find that this is a nothing story behind a tweet where he was legitimately praising his wife the moment he woke up to see the extra effort she is doing.

I dated men who said it's not gonna be a choice you're gonna be the homemaker and I was like well what am I going to do before we have kids? And they would be shocked and say well I guess you'll be cleaning the house. That wasn't going to work for me and I wasn't okay with that. The husband I married supports me In the fact that when we got married I wanted to work. Went to school, found a job I loved, and supported me when I said I want to keep working when we have kids. He also supported me and said we have the money to do so and I will get a raise when I said it is so much money to pay for day care that I think it's time to let me just be a stay at home mom. That's the difference. My husband encourages the choices that I make but also supports when it came time to support our family. He never undermines my contribution to the family roll and considers what I do a full-time job like his. We also are still a team when it comes to being parents together. A good example is my husband came home and I had dinner made and while I bathed the kids, he did the dishes and while he read books I moved the laundry around. So we are doing what I think feminist would throw a big fit over nowadays but it is different from the past because there is a mutual understanding that this isn't based on gender this is based on being a team and this is what works for our family. Feminist have lost sight of being viewed as equals but mainly focus on men are worthless and anyone doing what makes them happy with a man who shows them respect is putting their efforts in the trash. I would say what they are doing is actually causing the original goal being thrown in the trash., \n",

My interest is personal as I flew on Concorde 4 times and always considered it to be not only the most incredible passenger aircraft of all time but also the safest. So when I learned here that it had a history of tyre failure and fuel tank rupture I was shocked. Combined with the maintenance failure by Airfrance, and the same with the DC10, it left me totally dismayed that such negligence could be possible with passenger aircraft. My flights were with BA so maybe their maintenance was to a higher standard than Airfrance but that still leaves the tyre failure issue as a major concern. I was very sad when this accident occurred, more so now I realise it was totally avoidable, and the loss of Concorde is disappointing but maybe a good thing considering what we see in this vid, as it seems this accident could have occurred at any time, with an even greater loss of life. RIP to the victims and my condolences to their family and friends, it was a long time ago but very tragic and very significant., \n",
