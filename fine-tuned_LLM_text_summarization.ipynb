        "#### Intro:\n",
        "\n",
        "YouTube video descriptions are vital for attracting viewers, but often contain extraneous information that hinders understanding. This project utilizes transformer-based text summarization models (like BERT and GPT) to automatically clean these descriptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "By training a summarization model on a dataset of YouTube descriptions paired with their human-refined counterparts, the model learns to identify and remove irrelevant content while preserving key points. This leads to concise, informative descriptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project will explore the fine-tuning and evaluation of transformer models for this specific summarization task, focusing on their ability to remove extraneous information and produce distilled video descriptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Points:**\n",
        "- Problem: YouTube descriptions often contain excessive tags, promotions, and irrelevant details.\n",
        "- Solution: Transformer-based text summarization models trained to clean descriptions.\n",
        "- Approach: Fine-tune models on a dataset of original and human-cleaned descriptions.\n",
        "- Goal: Produce concise, informative descriptions that enhance user experience.\n",
        "- Evaluation: Focus on the models' ability to remove extraneous information effectively."

        "\n",
        "**Who is LoRA?**\n",
        "\n",
        "LoRA, which stands for Low-Rank Adaptation, is a technique used in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to make them more efficient and less computationally expensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key points about LoRA:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Reduced parameter updates: Instead of updating all the parameters of a pre-trained LLM during fine-tuning, LoRA focuses on updating a smaller set of parameters, specifically low-rank matrices that are added to the existing model weights.\n",
        "- Efficiency: This approach significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters, leading to faster training times and lower memory requirements compared to traditional fine-tuning methods.\n",
        "- Preserved performance: Despite the reduction in updated parameters, LoRA has been shown to achieve comparable or even better performance than full fine-tuning in many cases.\n",
        "- Adaptability: It can be easily integrated with various LLM architectures and fine-tuning tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "LoRA offers a practical and effective solution to fine-tune large language models for specific tasks without incurring the high computational costs associated with full fine-tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**To fine-tune the BART model with LoRA, we will follow these steps:**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Set Up LoRA Configuration:** Defining the LoRA parameters such as rank `(r)`, scaling factor `(lora_alpha)`, target modules `(q_proj and v_proj)`, dropout rate `(lora_dropout)`, etc.\n",
        "2. **Wrap the BART Model with LoRA:** We use the peft library to apply LoRA to the original BART model, which allows for efficient fine-tuning with fewer trainable parameters.\n",
        "3. **Define Training Arguments:** Configuring the training parameters like `batch size`, `number of epochs`, `learning rate`, `logging steps`, `evaluation strategy`, and `saving intervals` using the `TrainingArguments` class from Hugging Face.\n",
        "4. **Define the Compute Metrics Function:** Setting up a function to compute evaluation metrics such as `ROUGE scores`, which measure the quality of the generated summaries against the reference summaries.\n",
        "5. **Train the Model:** We use the Hugging Face Trainer to fine-tune the LoRA-wrapped model on the training dataset while evaluating it on a validation dataset during training to monitor the model's performance.\n",
        "6. **Evaluate the Fine-Tuned Model:** After training,we evaluate the model's performance on the validation dataset using the `ROUGE metric` to understand how well the model generates summaries.\n",
        "7. **Save the Fine-Tuned Model:** Lastly we save the fine-tuned model and tokenizer for future use in generating summaries or further fine-tuning.\n"

But an INSIDE EDITION investigation found that while some menus advertise Kobe beef, they are actually serving up meat of lesser value. Kobe beef, which has a marbled appearance, comes from pure-bred cattle raised on a special diet in Japan. The meat can cost $55 dollars an ounce, and only 400 pounds get shipped to in the U.S. each month, according to Kobe beef distributor Brent Nakama. #InsideEdition\\nChapters\\nView all\\nIntro\\n0:00\\nWhat sets this beef apart\\n0:40\\nCan you believe Kobe burgers and Kobe hotdogs\\n0:56\\nI like to order a Kobe hotdog\\n1:07\\nI just wanted to know\\n1:28\\nInside Edition\\n13.4M subscribers\\nVideos\\nAbout\\nFacebook\\nInstagram\\nTikTok\\nTwitter\\nShow less\",\n          \"Click Subscribe & turn on notifications and LET\\u2019S BECOME BEST FRIENDS!\\n\\nBEST of / FUNNIEST COMPILATION\\nAnimals https://bit.ly/AnimalsCompilation\\nFast Food https://bit.ly/FastFoodCompilation\\nJesus https://bit.ly/JesusComp\\nClothing http://bit.ly/JGClothingCompilation\\nDonuts https://bit.ly/JGDonuts\\nStores http://bit.ly/JGStores\\nCatholic http://bit.ly/JGCatholic\\nDrinking    \\u2022 Best DRINKING Jokes | Stand-Up Compil...  \\nDisney    \\u2022 Best Disney World Jokes | Stand-Up Co...  \\nJapan    \\u2022 Best Japan Jokes | Jim Gaffigan Stand...  \\nFish    \\u2022 The FUNNIEST Fish Jokes of 2020 | Sta...  \\nCheese    \\u2022 Best Cheese Jokes | Jim Gaffigan Stan...  \\nHeaven & Hell    \\u2022 Funniest Heaven and Hell Jokes | Jim ...  \\nTV    \\u2022 Best Watching TV Jokes | Jim Gaffigan...  \\nDesserts    \\u2022 Funniest Dessert Stand Up Jokes | Jim...  \\nHolidays    \\u2022 Best Holiday Jokes 2020 - Jim Gaffigan  \\nBirthdays    \\u2022 Funniest Stand-up Birthday Jokes | Ji...  \\nKorean    \\u2022 Funniest Stand-up Birthday Jokes | Ji...  \\nNordic    \\u2022 Best Nordic Jokes 2020 - Jim Gaffigan...  \\nDogs    \\u2022 Funniest Dog Stand up Jokes | Jim Gaf...  \\nHistory    \\u2022 Funniest History Jokes | Jim Gaffigan...  \\nOutdoor    \\u2022 Best Outdoor Jokes | Stand-Up Compila...  \\nChinese    \\u2022 Best Outdoor Jokes | Stand-Up Compila...  \\nEating    \\u2022 Funniest Eating Jokes | Jim Gaffigan  \\nHyiegene    \\u2022 Funniest Hygiene Stand-up Jokes | Jim...  \\nReading    \\u2022 Funniest Reading Jokes | Jim Gaffigan  \\nDoctors    \\u2022 Best Doctor Jokes | Stand-Up Compilation  \\nExcercise    \\u2022 Funniest Exercise Jokes - Jim Gaffiga...  \\n\\nOUR MASSIVE PLANET    \\u2022 Jim Gaffigan  \\\"OUR MASSIVE PLANET: WH...  \\n\\nHEALTHY & HAPPY Gardening \\nINTRO  https://bit.ly/HappyandHealthy1\\nCORN https://bit.ly/HappyandHealthyCorn\\n\\nTHE PALE TOURIST  \\nAsian American (Full Set) https://bit.ly/JGAsianAmerican\\nFlorida Man (Full Set) https://bit.ly/JGFloridaMan\\nOntario vs Quebec https://bit.ly/JGOntario\\nSuperstitions https://bit.ly/JGSuperstition\\nTourists https://bit.ly/JGTourist\\nHalifax Donair https://bit.ly/JGDonair\\nRodeo https://bit.ly/JGRodeo\\nDrake Story https://bit.ly/JGDrake\\n\\nQUALITY TIME \\nMarathons https://bit.ly/JGMarathons\\nHorses https://bit.ly/JGHorses\\nAppendix https://bit.ly/JGAppendix\\nMuseums https://bit.ly/JGMuseum\\nLying https://bit.ly/JGLying\\nCold Weather https://bit.ly/JGColdWeather\\n\\nNOBLE APE\\nMy Wife's Brain Tumor https://bit.ly/JGBrainTumor\\nMassages https://bit.ly/JGMassage\\nPope https://bit.ly/JGPope\\nUK vs US https://bit.ly/JGUSAvCanada\\n\\nCINCO\\nMorning Person https://bit.ly/JGMorning\\nSteak is Manly https://bit.ly/JGSteak\\nHiking https://bit.ly/JGHiking\\nIdiot Abroad https://bit.ly/JGIdiotAbroad\\nEasier to be a Guy https://bit.ly/JGBeaGuy\\nBig Family https://bit.ly/JGBigFamily\\n\\nOBSESSED\\nWeddings https://bit.ly/JGWeddingsyay\\nVictoria's Secret https://bit.ly/JGSecret\\nCan't Stop Eating https://bit.ly/JGstopeating\\n\\nMR.
