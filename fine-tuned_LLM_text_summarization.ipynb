    "#### Intro:\n",
    "\n",
    "YouTube video descriptions are vital for attracting viewers, but often contain extraneous information that hinders understanding. This project utilizes transformer-based text summarization models (like BERT and GPT) to automatically clean these descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By training a summarization model on a dataset of YouTube descriptions paired with their human-refined counterparts, the model learns to identify and remove irrelevant content while preserving key points. This leads to concise, informative descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will explore the fine-tuning and evaluation of transformer models for this specific summarization task, focusing on their ability to remove extraneous information and produce distilled video descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- Problem: YouTube descriptions often contain excessive tags, promotions, and irrelevant details.\n",
    "- Solution: Transformer-based text summarization models trained to clean descriptions.\n",
    "- Approach: Fine-tune models on a dataset of original and human-cleaned descriptions.\n",
    "- Goal: Produce concise, informative descriptions that enhance user experience.\n",
    "- Evaluation: Focus on the models' ability to remove extraneous information effectively."
