        "\n",
        "4. **Text Standardization**:\n",

        "    - Remove extra whitespace and redundant characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Language-Specific Processing**:\n",
        "    - Apply language-specific preprocessing techniques for better accuracy, such as stemming or lemmatization.\n",
        "    - Consider translation or transliteration if necessary for multilingual comments.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Tokenization and Lemmatization**:\n",

But in case it\\u2019s not enough for you for some reason, it\\u2019s also on average twice as expensive to enforce it on a convict than life in prison without parole is. This is due to the appeals court process, which typically takes around a decade or more. So enforcing the death penalty on people means way more of our tax dollars are being spent on horrible people than necessary. The literal only reason to keep this policy around is a primitive desire for vengeance as well as valuing an emotional response over a practical one. It\\u2019s kinda funny that conservatives constantly tout a \\u201cfacts over feelings\\u201d mentality, yet they are the most gung ho about maintaining the death penalty, and in many cases support increasing its hold over the American justice system.

That should be enough to completely abolish it, considering all the support for it is motivated by anger over people unjustly killed. But in case it’s not enough for you for some reason, it’s also on average twice as expensive to enforce it on a convict than life in prison without parole is. This is due to the appeals court process, which typically takes around a decade or more. So enforcing the death penalty on people means way more of our tax dollars are being spent on horrible people than necessary. The literal only reason to keep this policy around is a primitive desire for vengeance as well as valuing an emotional response over a practical one. It’s kinda funny that conservatives constantly tout a “facts over feelings” mentality, yet they are the most gung ho about maintaining the death penalty, and in many cases support increasing its hold over the American justice system. The most emotionally driven policy in existence, considering it is nothing but a practical liability.

Secondly, research is ongoing for new battery technologies and mining with BEV, if the whole chain of producing a battery was CO2 neutral then the initial emissions would also be lower and third the production of \"green\" gasoline would require vast amounts of crop fields that cover the entire earth to produce enough ethanol to satisfy the whole fleet of ICE vehicles. So it's a complex problem, but BEV is the way to go together with replacing our old coal/oil/gas powerplants with renewables and nuclear.

That should be enough to completely abolish it, considering all the support for it is motivated by anger over people unjustly killed. But in case it’s not enough for you for some reason, it’s also on average twice as expensive to enforce it on a convict than life in prison without parole is. This is due to the appeals court process, which typically takes around a decade or more. So enforcing the death penalty on people means way more of our tax dollars are being spent on horrible people than necessary. The literal only reason to keep this policy around is a primitive desire for vengeance as well as valuing an emotional response over a practical one. It’s kinda funny that conservatives constantly tout a “facts over feelings” mentality, yet they are the most gung ho about maintaining the death penalty, and in many cases support increasing its hold over the American justice system. The most emotionally driven policy in existence, considering it is nothing but a practical liability.

Secondly, research is ongoing for new battery technologies and mining with BEV, if the whole chain of producing a battery was CO2 neutral then the initial emissions would also be lower and third the production of \"green\" gasoline would require vast amounts of crop fields that cover the entire earth to produce enough ethanol to satisfy the whole fleet of ICE vehicles. So it's a complex problem, but BEV is the way to go together with replacing our old coal/oil/gas powerplants with renewables and nuclear.
