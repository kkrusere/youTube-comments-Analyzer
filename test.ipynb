Tesla regularly gives you free over the air updates which adds new software, bug fixes, and updated maps. Other automakers want you to buy their latest model for that, and charges you for navigation updates.\\n\\n-Not everyone has a way to charge an EV at home.

Also, charging infrastructure issues (location, reliability, payment options and incompatible plug standards) – not to mention complete lack of charging options for renters – are not giving potential buyers warm fuzzy feelings.

I work for The Ford Store Morgan Hill, a dealer in Northern California and last week I delivered a used Ford F-150 Lightning with 17k miles to Carlsbad, Ca which is in San Diego County.  The distances was around 406 miles from Morgan Hill, Ca, the range before I put the address on the GPS in the truck was 316, after the address was put in it was roughly 250 miles.  I had to charge in just under 200 miles and the charger was about 2 miles away from I-5.  No problem at that charger, which was at a Shell station with a Taco Bell, breakfast while I waited to charge to 82% it took 37 minutes and it cost $40.32.  When I left that charging station on HWY 43, the truck told me I had to charge again in Santa Clarita at a Walmart which was 87 miles from the first charger.  I found the Walmart and the chargers easily, but one of the 350 kw charger was broken, the others were being used and I lucked out that an ID 4 charging on the 150 kw charger was just finishing charging and I plugged in for about 30 minutes.  I was then on my way to Carlsbad through the lovely So Cal traffic, I was fortunate that the truck had carpool stickers which helped at lot through that nightmare traffic mid-morning.  I got to Carlsbad with a 90 mile range.  I decided to go to the chargers at an outlet mall in Carlsbad so I could deliver the truck to the customer with more than a 90 mile range.  At those chargers there was 4 chargers with one of them was broken, and the others were being used.  I gave up and delivered the truck with just under 90 miles left.

Ford and GM went head first into a market they know very little about. They know ICE vehicles, they do not know enough about EV’s to make the investments they did. Jim Farley followed Mary Barra down a rabbit hole without knowing what was on the other side. Market day supply is important. 60 days had been the target, back in 2020 and 2021 we saw that supply go down to 10-12 days. I believe a good mix is about 30 days. 90-100 days for EV’s shrink profits sharply. (Dealers get floor plan credits) floor plan credits cover the interest to have the vehicle on the lot. It covers 60 days. If you are turning your inventory every 30 days, you are picking up about $700 in additional profit. At 90 days, you lose the $700, plus another $700 to the bank. A $1400 swing in 60 days is a lot of money when you are talking about a dealership that sells 200 vehicles per month. $1.6.-1.7 million dollars a year is nothing to sneeze at.

However, I found that Mercedes EVs didn\\'t prioritize the typical EV features, like regenerative braking. They lacked a proper one-pedal drive system and seemed more focused on comfort than addressing my questions.\\n\\nGenesis and their Electrified GV70 had performance issues with the air conditioning and seats, but the car handled regenerative braking well. The real problem was the service center\\'s one-star reviews in my area, which made potential buyers wary.\\n\\nAt Audi, I couldn\\'t even get a single salesman to assist us despite multiple requests. Although the car wasn\\'t bad, the seats became uncomfortable during extended use. However, the RS E-tron had a more comfortable seat.\\n\\nMy experience at BMW with the iX was remarkably different. From the moment I walked in, they assigned me a dedicated salesman who didn\\'t pressure me. He was able to answer all my questions. We conducted several test drives, including highway drives. The car\\'s regenerative braking was exceptional, and it offered impressive range; some drivers report getting 360 miles from a 305-mile range.\\n\\nAs for Cadillac\\'s Lyriq, the car itself had no issues. However, acquiring a car with super cruise proved to be a challenge. Dealers at two different locations informed me that no one who ordered a Sport 2 or Luxury 2 in 2022 had received their cars, while buyers of Sport 1, Luxury 1, and Tech 1 had received theirs. Additionally, the saleswoman was preoccupied with other customers despite our scheduled appointment, resulting in a 20-minute wait for a test drive.\\n\\nThere were more dealerships I visited, but this is already becoming a lengthy post.\\nRead more\\n85\\nReply\\n17 replies\\n@DGander007\\n2 months ago\\nThe thing the dealers don’t want you to know is that they really make their money after they sell you the car. They make more $ off you for all the services that a traditional car requires. With EV’s there’s almost no maintenance. It’s not the range, it’s not the cost of batteries, it’s not that it’s more difficult to sell. There’s simply no incentive in it for them to sell EV’S. I bought new a 2020 Nissan Altima. It’s got 50k miles on it and I’m dealing with transmission fluid changes, oil changes, fuel dilution in the oil because it is a direct injection engine(like most ICE vehicles), carbon buildup on the valves, fluid change for my transfer case and differential. It never ends. And this is for a car that runs great.  My next car will absolutely be a Tesla model 3. About the same price as my Altima but gets equivalent of 70MPG and is fast as a Porsche with almost no maintenance.

They need to have a look at what this market looks like for the average consumers, especially middle-lower incomes. You mostly can only get EVs new off the lot, which is not accessible to all incomes (not to mention the current economic climate). EV prices are sky high, and even though they have less maintenance costs in theory, getting into an accident with them is no joke. We have predatory practices installed my manufacturers already, asking consumers to pay outrageous prices for new batteries which need to be replaced for some minor accidents. Also the predatory practices happening at the dealers who have realized that they can mark-up vehicles to ridiculous degrees if they have waiting lists (thanks to the pandemic shortage). If you buy used, there has been emerging reports that batteries have a poor life cycle and will often have a much shorter range than expected after just a few years. Replacing a battery is a five figure price. Colder climates can severely drop your range. And on top of all that, many places still have very poor charging station networks, and it is common to find them broken or not charging as it should. Oh, and this might be regional, but our electric bills have sky rocketed as well in recent times.

Another thing I didn\\'t think about is that while camping for a couple of days, the parked car lost significant charge. Not something you have to worry about happening with a gasoline car.

If someone made a true hybrid (electric motor drives the car from the battery pack, the ICE is a small highly optimized super-efficient single speed that does nothing but come on and charge the battery pack when it falls below 20% charge) that would be interesting but they don\\'t, they make basically an ICE with added complexity of an EV - too tiny battery pack in parallel - not well optimized.

These are the two biggest hurdles I can see that is causing people to not make the move.  Once we have this, and perhaps good battery warranties (like 100k miles or 10 years) then people might start adopting EVs as a mode of transportation, but it seems currently the only people who are perhaps seriously considering or have bought an EV are those who probably don\\'t commute much or take long trips (some do, but most probably don\\'t due to their limited range and the additional hassle there is with traveling long distances with an EV.  Even if the average EV can do 350 miles, at 70 mph average, that\\'s only about 4-5 hours of driving ,then you have to stop and wait about an hour or two to charge and then continue, so this adds to your trip time and may mean ddriving 150-200 miles less per day over a gas vehicle.  Plus, since you are relying on recharging stations if you\\'re doing a trip, what happens if you find out a charging station you were planning to stop at is full or out of service?  At least with gas/diesel vehicles you just drive down to the next exit and there is likely a gas station that is open, and you basically have options (less of a problem, except maybe in very remote towns where there is perhaps one gas station that is the only gas station for 30 miles but for the most part, this is not really an issue for people traveling long distances along major roadways and through major cities.\\nRead more\\n18\\nReply\\n3 replies\\n@jegerm6752\\n2 months ago\\nI can\\'t speak for others, but for me, EVs should be much, much cheaper.

Fiat 500e,Kia Soul EV, Audi E-tron, now driving a Jaguar I-pace. I’ve also talked to many other EV owners. The biggest issue is public charging infrastructure. I would say it’s worse now than it was years ago because there are so many more EVs lining up at the stations. They are always breaking and the apps frequently have issues. I luckily can charge at home but I’ve heard of people waiting many hours to charge because they live in an apartment and need to get to work the next morning.\\nRead more\\n46\\nReply\\n20 replies\\n@brewstermcfly\\n5 months ago\\nI have been using a hybrid since 2012.

Essentially, EVs are difficult to use if you live in an apartment or condo, even people who live in apartments and condos tend to live in more urban areas where EV\\'s short range doesn\\'t matter. On the other hand, EVs are difficult to use for long distance trips or longer commutes because of range and the time to recharge, which makes them difficult to use in Rural or far suburb environments.\\n\\nThe ideal environment for EV use is in close suburbs, which tend to have both houses and short average travel distances. These areas tend to be wealthier, and have seen wider EV adoption, especially in places like CA with expensive gas. Now that that market has been captured, EVs are trying to move into other markets, but in those markets the choice between an ICE vehicle and EV vehicle is a tradeoff, not a pure win. \\n\\nIt remains to be seen whether the supercharger network will expand and whether apartments and condos will add more overnight charging capacity. If both of these things happen, EV use will become a lot more broad. I suspect that this will take a while, as it is somewhat of a chicken-or-egg scenario.\\nRead more\\n41\\nReply\\n8 replies\\n@stevencorrea7378\\n5 months ago\\nA huge factor not discussed is the true cost of ownership and resale value (put aside the time it takes to charge).

When you actually get an EV you find in just everyday use you actually get around 2/3 of their stated range and there are always issues that crop up as well. When under any kind of weather issue (you know such things as \"rain\" \"Snow\" or such rare issues as \"Winter, Autumn, or Spring) you find you are getting less than half performance. As around 30% of people live in apartments not having a charging station available is a big issue. EVs have brilliant marketing, but the performance is no where near the marketing statements. Another large issue not seen yet is as the car ages battery life decreases so if you own one for five years withuot anything you have done the performance drops by 10-12% just due to the battery aging. Of course that is not mentioned at all. The salesmans Smartphone conjecture in the end is totally wrong for the comparrison. The correct comparison is that the smartphone costs 3 times that of the flipphone, but you have to recharge the smartphone everyday, it drops calls in midsentence, and you pay to repair it every month due to forseen issues that the manufacturer accepted as something to generate future revenue. Of course the Salesforce love something that can make them money.\\nRead more\\n30\\nReply\\n3 replies\\n@davidm8090\\n5 months ago\\nOne thing that is never discussed is actual range.  Most ev\\'s don\\'t recommend you use 100% of the battery.  You should only go down to 20% and not go over 80% when you actually own the car to get max life out of the battery, so 40% of advertised capacity is gone.  Then, if you live in cold climates like Minnesota, your capacity drops again in the winter so the range can actually be quite short.  Therefore it is extremely tough to seriously consider an EV for me.\\nRead more\\n14\\nReply\\n4 replies\\n@bigprune333\\n2 months ago\\nI don\\'t even know anyone who can purchase a new vehicle.

For most people, electric cars will continue to be l believe a bad fit for many, so unless the issues with electric cars are cleaned up, ice will be around for a while yet.

Considerably more \\'stuff\\' needs to be mined, refined, processed and manufactured to create an EV. Moreover on the road there may be zero emissions but these have probably just been moved down the road to the nearest power station (unless it is a solar/wind farm etc - unlikely).\\n\\nRANGE ANXIETY: used for short repeated journeys an EV would be a expensively useful second car option. The problems arise when touring / on long distance trips. Leaving aside that the infrastructure more or less doesn\\'t exist, even where it does it is a highly unsatisfactory experience. It takes a long time to charge a battery. If someone gets to a station before you it will be an even longer wait. If there are multiple stations the available load is probably reduced and shared amongst the stations. To interact with the station you may well have to \\'download an App\\' and register details with the service provider.\\n\\nTYRES: EV batteries are extremely heavy (typically 300->400kg). Electric motors are more powerful than their ICE equivalents. Put the two things together an you have a vehicle that will chew through expensive tyres.\\n\\nFIRE HAZARD EV batteries are a massive fire hazard. Considerable effort is taken to mitigate the risks but it is always there.\\n\\nINSURANCE: Any damage that might compromise a battery will require an extremely expensive battery replacement. Minor shunts can turn into total write off’s (a replacement battery would cost more than the residual value of the car). Further EVs are much heavier with power to match so any collisions will be more serious (there probably needs to be a review of road crash standards). Consequently insurance costs for EV\\'s are significantly higher.\\n\\nDEPRECIATION: with increasing \\'flying hours\\' it is becoming clear that EV hype does not match reality. Unfortunately early adopters are finding that their very expensive purchases have very poor residual values.\\n\\nRAW MATERIALS: current mining capacity is incapable of delivering enough raw materials to deliver \\'GEN 1\\' of an EV fleet, never mind the massive upgrade to power generation and distribution infrastructure that would be required to make it work. There pretty much is a moratorium on opening mines world wide. This is incompatible with \\'we need more copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite etc for EV batteries\\'. Where mining does occur it tends to be in the last places where it should occur eg the DRC. Little or no thought seems to have been given to what will happen with the large pile of toxic \\'GEN 1\\' batteries when they are thrown on the scrap heap.\\n\\nTHE CAR OWNS YOU AS MUCH AS YOU OWN IT: An EV typically comes with lots of \\'smarts\\' and may well require that you interact with it though an \\'App\\'. It will have lots of opinions about it\\'s use. There are many reports of owners being locked in or locked out of their vehicles when \\'computer says no\\'. Manual knobs may well be replaced with touch screen menus that are a distraction hazard. Manufacturers will log GPS records, internet activity etc. Fine if you want to \\'have a relationship\\' with your car as opposed to \\'own it\\'.\\n\\nWhat can I say - I\\'m tired of seeing people driving about EV\\'s that are the size of a tank, that the average person cannot afford, where stolen subsidies are given to a deluded privileged few so that they can they can pat themselves on the back for \\'saving the planet\\' (NOT).\\nRead more\\nReply\\n@user-qs6jb2mn3e\\n2 months ago\\nand Tesla is still not interested in doing POS credit, and insists on people filing taxes and claim for a refund.\\nReply\\n@Alphasantury\\n3 weeks ago\\nI love a long distance travel i don\\'t want to buy EV i hate it also\\n2\\nReply\\n@pp3k3jamail\\n2 months ago\\nElectric vehicles are stupid over here in the east coast and really across America a week ago we had a mini ice age.

It must seat 8 (driver plus 7 passengers), have the same or more storage space as my current gas-powered van, be able to be 100% charged in 10 minutes or less, be able to have a 500+ mile range on 1 charge, and cost $5000 or less. I live in an area that can get to -50 Fahrenheit with wind chill in the winter, so it must not lose much charge power in the cold, too. Unlike some people, I am unwilling to lower my standard requirements. There is also not enough charging station infrastructure for me to consider it as well. Some people say I have unrealistic requirements, but as of right now, an EV just does not fit my lifestyle and budget. I have only ever owned used cars, so I am not in the market for a new EV.\\nRead more\\nReply\\n@SuperBennnnnnnnn\\n2 months ago\\nwith the increase in cost of electricity, EVS are a trap.

I bought a new Nissan LEAF in 2012, and I traded it for a 2022 LEAF. The development of vehicles has been good IMHO; the 2012 LEAF was an excellent first generation electric vehicle, and the 2022 LEAF was a great improvement on the already great start. Rollout of charging infrastructure has continued on an increasing trajectory. I have 2 specific criticisms: (1) I feel that Nissan has left me holding the bag as manufacturers (including Nissan) move to the NACS charging standard, with no upgrade path other than buying a new vehicle. That said, even at this point, new Chademo infrastructure is being built out, albeit slowly. Maybe there will eventually be a 3rd party NACS conversion for the LEAF. (2) The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission has REALLY dropped the ball. Although they started years ago to install fast charging at the service plazas, after equipping just a few, they stopped, and it\\'s been in this unfinished state for years. The Turnpike really needs to get its act together so EV drivers do not have to exit the Turnpike to recharge.\\nRead more\\nReply\\n@linaluna5514\\n2 months ago\\nI’m going to say it.

            "Description: In August 2023, it took about twice as long to sell an EV in the U.S. as it did the previous January. Prices of EVs are down 22% year-over-year and that's mainly driven by Tesla. About two thirds of EVs sold are Elon Musk's brand. Companies like Ford have ramped up hybrid production as demand has leveled off. While slightly more than half of consumers say EVs are the future and will eventually replace Internal Combustion Engines, less than a third of dealers say so. This all comes at a time when investments in EVs are more than ever. So what's really going on? Watch the video to learn more.\n"
