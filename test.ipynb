My guess is people in city's and people answered that question based on an hour charge time after they park it in their garage on a Tuesday.  If you go ask people that take road trips, people that haul trailers, people that drive on their vacations vs fly, drive for a living, own medium duty trucks or SUV's that haul boats, jet skis, small or large RV's; every one of them is going to say that stopping for an hour to recharge in the middle of a road trip to camp for a long weekend is not acceptable.  AND there is NO EV that even comes close to hauling a trailer in an acceptable fashion.  Just go look at TFL EV (The Fast Lane Truck EV) youtube channel.  The couldn't even make it from Denver to Lake McCaughey (sp?) pulling a 16' trailer.  Stop using the power of the government to force people to live a certain way.\n",

Even people with a relatively high disposable income are getting sticker shock. Most of us are either holding on to the vehicle we have or looking at older cars that actually fit our budget. There simply aren’t “old” EVs yet. There isn’t a “bargain” EV for me to buy right now. The only vehicles that are sane to buy right now are older vehicles from like 2014 and even those feel like a punch to the face in the dark. I’ll also say of the new cars rolling out today, it feels like more than half the car’s MSRP is being determined by smart technology features. Feels like I’m buying a computer that can also be a car, when what I need in a vehicle to get me from point A to B.\n",

Most Americans simply do not want one, and many simply can’t afford one. People who want EVs already drive them. Why don’t all Americans want to drive these? Current electric cars are often expensive, have limited range, and take much longer to charge then to simply fill up a tank of gas. Not to mention consumers never like being FORCED to do something, such as being forced to switch to EV, especially when it is still a new technology. I know very few people who would consider buying an EV. Especially being in a cold New England state. On cold winter days, the 300-400 miles on a full charge can be cut by nearly 50%. So why bother? The cold weather is another strike against them. I’d get a hybrid at most.\n",

When you go weeks to months with temperatures that are below zero Fahrenheit and windchill factors consistently at -40 Fahrenheit or lower and that is without driving the vehicle in the wind.  You find that the average EV mileage between charges drops anywhere from 35% to 60%. Now EVs become unrealistic to drive in winter.  Tell me how would the EVs handle the actual temperature overnight of -39 Fahrenheit and windchill was between -60 to -80 Fahrenheit. This actually occurred one to two weeks ago depending on when you read this.  This was out in the country, not city, with no garage to house the vehicle. Gas vehicles had to be started every 4 hours and run for 30 minutes.  EVs don't profit by doing that, do they?  EVs are not realistic for millions of Americans who experience harsh winters.\n",

            "Comment Text: I believe the biggest problem in EVs is when it comes to public charging (except Tesla).  I work for The Ford Store Morgan Hill, a dealer in Northern California and last week I delivered a used Ford F-150 Lightning with 17k miles to Carlsbad, Ca which is in San Diego County.  The distances was around 406 miles from Morgan Hill, Ca, the range before I put the address on the GPS in the truck was 316, after the address was put in it was roughly 250 miles.  I had to charge in just under 200 miles and the charger was about 2 miles away from I-5.  No problem at that charger, which was at a Shell station with a Taco Bell, breakfast while I waited to charge to 82% it took 37 minutes and it cost $40.32.  When I left that charging station on HWY 43, the truck told me I had to charge again in Santa Clarita at a Walmart which was 87 miles from the first charger.  I found the Walmart and the chargers easily, but one of the 350 kw charger was broken, the others were being used and I lucked out that an ID 4 charging on the 150 kw charger was just finishing charging and I plugged in for about 30 minutes.  I was then on my way to Carlsbad through the lovely So Cal traffic, I was fortunate that the truck had carpool stickers which helped at lot through that nightmare traffic mid-morning.  I got to Carlsbad with a 90 mile range.  I decided to go to the chargers at an outlet mall in Carlsbad so I could deliver the truck to the customer with more than a 90 mile range.  At those chargers there was 4 chargers with one of them was broken, and the others were being used.  I gave up and delivered the truck with just under 90 miles left.  Very challenging trip but not impossible.  All the chargers were Electrify America which is the company that the Ford vehicles send you to.  The customer service at Electrify America sucks,  no one answers the phones.  By the way our dealer does not mark-up any vehicle.\n",

            "Description: In August 2023, it took about twice as long to sell an EV in the U.S. as it did the previous January. Prices of EVs are down 22% year-over-year and that's mainly driven by Tesla. About two thirds of EVs sold are Elon Musk's brand. Companies like Ford have ramped up hybrid production as demand has leveled off. While slightly more than half of consumers say EVs are the future and will eventually replace Internal Combustion Engines, less than a third of dealers say so. This all comes at a time when investments in EVs are more than ever. So what's really going on? Watch the video to learn more.\n"
