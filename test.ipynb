If the connection clip is loose enough and  you dont hold the plug in the socket during the handshake, the plug weight can actually cause it to pull just far enough off the pins to sever the connection and disrupt the handshake.

It feels like the US is at least 10years behind. Would be interesting to know why, also seeing that there is no \"EMP/EMSP\" role in the US market (charging tariff cards that work/roam across all networks). In Central/Western Europe nowadays you don't need to worry anymore about chargers not working, we are at up-times of 95% and greater - for modern HPC (fast chargers) it's even more like 99% and more.\n",

Plus they have auto-charge, so no messing with cards or apps after the initial setup. And their up time record is insanely great, it is in fact one of the most important things they focus on as a business. Other charging networks have similar reputations (Ionity for example). Constant remote monitoring of charging stalls and stations, pro-active servicing, and using top of the line hardware appears to be the way they achieve such results. From what I've seen and heard, US charging networks can learn a lot from how things are being done in Europe.\n",

            "Comment Text: Based on my experience what you show in LA seems to actually be better than here in Florida! The Tesla network is absolutely the way to go… very high 98% reliability and even if there’s an odd charger out of order, the software will let you know before you get there. Even in that instance, you’ll be dealing with let’s say one stall out of order out of maybe a dozen at one location. Thank you for bringing this issue to light, this is by far away the big bad news in EV life and it seems it’s wide spread. On a recent trip to the UK I ran into similar problems. I think investors in the non-tesla networks should pay close attention to this problem. If they don’t fix these problems before Tesla’s super chargers are scaled they will be out of business. This is not a new problem either, I’ve been using charging networks since 2014 and this has perpetually been a problem. The only network in the USA which has solved the problem is Tesla . The recent decisions by most vehicle manufacturers to adopt the Tesla standard is the writing on the wall. I’ve driven my tesla over 216,000 miles through 40+ states almost exclusively using Tesla super chargers and almost never have a problem. If buying an EV, go for it, make sure to ask the dealer if the car will accept NACS in the near future and be aware than in the interim you’ll have to deal with the issues in this video until then (mostly this will not effect you if doing home charging, but definitely something to be aware of if you take road trips!)\n",

A month ago we took a trip in our Model X to Chaco Canyon in New Mexico from Newport Beach CA (1600 miles total). The trip had us in very remote regions and back towards Page Arizona, through Zion UT and back to Las Vegas. And while this trip did require additional time and planning for charging, all the Tesla superchargers worked perfectly and were available when we arrived. The network is growing and I was pleasantly surprised how smooth the trip went. We have free supercharging for life so this does factor into our decision making-full disclosure.\n",

Gas pumps are pretty reliable - every once in a while you see one out of service, but they have very high reliability.   And they have moving parts, an actual motor and belt and pump head and plumbing, along with a number of safety valves and product switching valves and sensors and stuff.   An EV charger needs NONE of that stuff.  No moving parts.   Just a step down transformer, a high efficiency solid state rectifier with voltage regulation, payment processing equipment and a small control board to run everything.    The payment processing equipment and the control board are solved problems, because the gas pumps use the same payment processing and ruggedized single board controller.   And the transformer and rectifier being solid state with no moving parts, and for the transformer completely passive, they should almost never break.   Its crazy that they are broken all the time.   Its just bad design plain and simple.\n",
