            "Comment Text: I'd love to see more competition in the auto industry to keep prices down. However, I always have a few concerns over companies operating out of China. How much control will the Chinese government have over this company in terms of money, information on clients, ethical concerns. Will they be accountable for recalls when they need to happen, or will they be protected by their government from that accountability? How good have they been at honouring warranties? Can the cameras in the vehicles be used to spy on us in any way? Based on my previous experiences with Chinese sellers over smaller items, it doesn't fill me with confidence to buy such an expensive product from them. I once was sold a rusty product (literally), took pictures and asked for an exchange or refund, they basically pretended to not understand me well until they eventually resorted to telling me to \"F-Off\" in a nutshell. I was just SOL at that point. Consumer protection laws is not something that can be enforced in China, and their government doesn't yield to any sort of international pressure on ethical dilemmas.\n",

And more importantly, it gives people more choices in vehicle market and people don't need to choose among those cars from Japan or Europe (no disrespect these are good cars but because they have the technology, brand, and patents back then and Chinese cars sucked. Now these foreign cars don't have the edge over Chinese cars like BYD. They still use a old external or interior design, out-of-dated infotainment system, etc and the price is still pretty high.

Another big issue with BYD and other Chinese makers is the service, they are not shipping enough parts to cover service. Often cars are waiting over 6 months in service centers. Leasing a vehicle and paying lease without using the car is just meaningless. So There are wide range of issues not covered here. BYD might of course be strong competitor to traditional OEMs like VW and Renault in Europe.\n",

They are pushing it for sure, but I think it's a step back as far as the push for EVs goes because it only solves a few of the problems with EVs and will increasingly sour our taste for them by highlighting the other problems.  Bonus for cost, domestic sourcing, lifetime cycles, and resistance to thermal runaway, but minus for energy density, range, and temperature sensitivity while charging.  We want range, safety, charging infrastructure, convenience, affordability, insurability and predictable maintenance costs, resale value, and durability.  If you wanna go there, how about making them weigh less to reduce wear and tear on roads and tires.  How else to compete with ICE?  Gotta crack those nuts.\n",

            "Comment Text: When one considers the large different in sticker prices between Chinese EVs and everyone else, that raised serious questions about fair competition.  What is the real cost to Chinese manufacturers for manufacturing their EVs?  Is the Chinese government handing out massive subsidies in a deliberate dumping scheme to undercut any competitor.  If so, that is illegal under international trade laws.  Capitalism is one thing, but state sponsored predatory capitalism is another.  A lot of comments below suggest that there isn't a problem with buying cheap Chinese products dumped on US markets.   May I suggest that one should look back over the last 40 years when retailers like Walmart destroyed thousands of local businesses by getting access to cheap Chinese products which put them out of business as well as many domestic manufacturers.  The is a price to paid for buying cheap.\n",

BYD has momentum on the bulls, but history shows how often and how hard that crash can be -- look at Rivian and others.  Everyone seems to have this super rosy perception of BYD, largely because they want to see Tesla and the legacies get a black eye?  And we already know today how detrimental it is the U.S.' economy in the long run when there's a flood of cheap Chinese imports (doesn't matter if it's electronics or anything else one can find on Amazon).  Nothing wrong with some increased competition to the Big 3, but it's really between hardline government legislation and policies, and subsidies, that we're even seeing things like this for BEV's.  Hybrids are taking off in the U.S. and such doesn't look to change until battery ranges get way better and lower cost (or similar costs to BYD's but at ranges of 750 mi + like Toyota is talking about with the solid-state batteries).\n",

            "Comment Text: At some point you have to stop and ask: \"Just what is it that EV's are supposed to be saving us from?\" There is one question that is never addressed that would expose the \"climate crisis\" for the scam that it is, which is \"What percentage of the atmosphere is CO2?\" The answer, never given in plain language, is that CO2 is currently around 420 parts per million, (google it) increased, they tell us, from 280 ppm in 1850. That's a difference of 140 ppm, or in terms more readily understood by the layman, the composition of the atmosphere has changed by 0.014% (14 thousandths of 1%) in the last 170 years. LESS THAN 1 THOUSANDTH OF 1% PER DECADE! How much closer to \"zero\" do they think it's possible to get? How gullible do you have to be to believe that this rate of change is causing extreme weather events, which have always happened and always will? Their claim is that this tiny amount \"traps heat\". ALL gasses dissipate heat and even if CO2 is an exception, the suggestion that a total of 0.042% can overwhelm the capacity of the remaining 99.958% to dissipate that heat is abject nonsense. CO2 DOES NOT control the global temperature, there is no \"climate crisis\". Wind farms, solar panels, heat pumps, EV's.. None of these measures are necessary, nor will they have the slightest effect on the weather. Eye-watering sums of money have already been wasted on this futile exercise. Time to wake up, stop throwing our money at these boondoggles and squandering the world's resources on projects that cannot possibly succeed as there never was a problem to begin with. There is no need to save the planet from a minuscule increase in the gas on which all life depends, but it does need to be rescued from idiot politicians and media mouthpieces that push this garbage.\n",

Elon will make money and force BYD if it comes to the US to be on its charging system. Furthermore, the competition forces Tesla to have refreshes still making others have to keep up or out do.\n",
