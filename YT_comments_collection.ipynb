It wasn’t over night and there were years and years of hoops to jump through and innovations to be made, now let’s look at that in an EV stand point (all electric not hybrid) they’ve decided to put a deadline on it and roll it out in a very short timeframe, that’s going to cause obvious issues. They’re putting things in these vehicles that’s not needed when it should be simplistic and streamline. I could write a novel on this, moral is sure yeah make the EV’s if there’s some sort of benefactor to the climate and quality of our living. But also release them slowly, make them simple and affordable to limit issues and dissatisfaction, r&d need to be done and it needs to be the focus of consecration to make a streamlined product people will be happy with. It’s an old acronym they need to revert back to “kiss” “keep it simple stupid” I think things would have been accepted much better had they done this first off!\n",

As a contractor, weighing the pros and cons of a gas truck against a Lightning or other electric truck,  I can see the massive benefits of an electric truck.  But that's only if I don't have to travel a lot, and only if the costs of these vehicles could be brought to a reasonable amount.  I would love to be able to plug my truck in when I get home and have it ready to go for a day of work the next day, eliminating the need to go get gas and consolidating an expense into another existing bill (even if that bill does go up).  It's also cheaper to operate, which sounds awesome.  Yes, I am aware the power still comes from burning coal etc and the carbon emissions reduction isn't what anyone was told it would be.  I wouldn't want one to \"save the planet.\"  I would want one because of the convenience and the additional storage space (A frunk!?  Yes please!) But I also recognize that not everyone has the same needs or wants as I do, nor do I think a huge push for electric vehicles should be made, at least until we've developed a better way to produce the power needed to charge them.  Infrastructure will adapt, but we need better, safer and more efficient ways to generate electricity before we can really start replacing a substantial portion of existing vehicles with EVs\n",

I quite like some things about it, the performance and the cheap running costs, however the charging infrastructure is laughable, and if they pulled the tax break I’d go back to internal combustion in a heartbeat.\n",

Please don’t buy the 3.5 Ecoboost. My neighbor has been at the dealership and left his F150 for over 3 weeks and it still has issues. The only f150, if you have to buy a Ford , that I recommend is the f150 with the 5.0 engine in it. No turbo just cubic inches. If you really want to buy a real truck buy a Tundra that will never break down on you. Thank you for listening. Certified ASE mechanic with 25 years experience.\n",

Adding 3 million EV's per year (let's say) is the equivalent of adding a million new homes. The administration is mandating 2/3 of all vehicles sold be EV's by the early 2030's; the equivalent of adding over 3 million new homes TO THE GRID every year.  The US has an overburdened, aging, and inefficient grid already. The demand that tens of millions of EV's will make upon this already overburdened grid will cause repeated blackouts and eventually we will literally have intermittant use of electric power in the US.

The ICE vehicles that they are currently selling were designed 5-10 years ago and by the time they are on the lots, they're already obsolete. Also, they literally depend on hundreds of disconnected suppliers for parts, so it is a logistical nightmare to redesign conventional vehicles to be EVs. Tesla is the antithesis of this.  They are completely vertically integrated and design their vehicles, manufacturing lines and the infrastructure to support them from the ground up.  They have been producing and perfecting EVs for 20 years and they're not stuck in the ridiculous cycle of trying to produce a new model every year for all the cars they sell.  The world will definitely move to electric vehicles and the legacy car manufacturers will disappear because they cannot accept that their old ways are obsolete.\n",

It was a great idea that was very poorly executed, just like now. Current EV owners are indeed getting rid of their EV's for a gas vehicle, because many of them felt they were lied too! The thermal efficiency of a battery is very low in colder temperatures. I guess that was never mentioned to the customer during the initial purchase. The cost of many EV batteries is well over $20k. That was never mentioned to the customer either. Most if not all batteries have a LIFE SPAN! which means eventually it will have to be replaced no matter what. OOPS! I guess that was never mentioned either. The depreciation rate of an EV is considerably higher than it's gas counterpart. I know that was never mentioned to ANY customer. In many places, charging an EV is higher in cost than it is for a gas vehicle. At least the drivers of these EV vehicles could drive past the gas pumps. To all of the EV owners out there, YOU ASKED FOR THIS! Enjoy!\n",

Every single cotton pickin’ consumer credit application that is filled out by potential buyer, even if the transaction doesn’t go thru cuz of credit score constraints, the dealer gets the full par value of the window sticker amount. The application is converted into a security and dealer completes an application for advance of federal reserve notes thru their federal reserve agent once the credit application signed by consumer/borrower and the appropriate forms per federal reserve operating circular 10 is submitted. The dealer, being fully paid before the loan docs are even signed, then finances the negotiated price to the borrower thru internal or external lender with a consumer credit contract binding borrowers to repay pure profit to the shareholders of that contract/aka security, which is then leveraged or hypothecated typically 100 times or more. So that $75k car  loan turns into millions on the secondary market/aka stock exchange, and the primary market/aka treasury paid the cost of the vehicle right out of the gates. Wonderful system we got, eh?\n",

            "Comment Text: Ford and GM only have their dealers to look at regarding the failures of their EV efforts. I have yet to go into any legacy automaker, both foreign and domestic, and be able to speak with a salesperson that actually wants to sell an EV. Every single one of the them will and have spoken down about EVs and have tried to move me over to an ICE vehicle. None of them I have spoken to even understood what they were “selling.” You cannot have a successful launch of a product if your dealers actively subvert it every chance they get. \n",
            "\n",
            "Legacy autos cannot yet compete with the likes of Tesla and other EV first companies, but mostly Tesla. At this point if I’m thinking EV the only real choice is Tesla, and that is mainly about the charging network. Until legacy automakers start building EVs with the NACS plugs they are still going to need to rely on a subpar charging network compared to Tesla’s. I just rented a Model 3 and took it on a 600+ mile road trip in this freezing cold weather and had zero charging issues. Only issue I had was that Hertz never filled the wiper fluid and I had to stop and buy some on the way back home due to the snow and salt rendering the windshield opaque.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Pricing should also be a non issue but media and the people who parrot the talking points all speak about how expensive EVs are. I’m sure no one is doing any type of actual research because I can easily find many Tesla’s under $40K with the tax incentive now at point of sale. Some states you can even pick one up for under $30k. If you want to find a deal … they are out there. \n",
            "\n",
            "Other issue with the GM’s and Ford’s out there is that they are taking legacy automaking into the EV process. They will never be able to compete on price and make a profit if all they are doing is taking ICE cars and dropping EV batteries and drivetrains in them. Yes their build quality is much better than Tesla’s but that comes at a price. I know Tesla likes to be viewed and priced as a luxury car manufacturer but I see them more like the initial Japanese cars of the 70’s and even the Hyundai’s and Yugo’s of the late 80’s. They are cheaply made cars looking to gain a foothold in a market not being effectively served by the big 3. I’m not gonna lie, while I love the Model 3 and Y, they are some of the most tinny cars out there. Be careful how you close the frunk because you might dent the hood. Don’t get into a minor accident because you’ll probably total the car. However, you will save a crap ton on gas and maintenance over the life time of the vehicle. As Tesla matures, the build quality will get better, but it needs volume and market share much like those early Japanese vehicles managed to score during the gas crisis of the 70’s. Now, those same Japanese vehicles and even Hyundai are among some of the most reliable and well built vehicles out there.\n",
            "\n",
            "We have to be careful here. There is a future with EVs coming and if the US carmakers cannot figure it out, we stand to lose it all. China is going all in on EVs and with many compelling offerings. Even with the tariffs there will come a point where they will be able to sell a cheap enough vehicle and gain a foothold in the American market. We will lose the EV and with that potentially the entire car market just like we lost the solar panel mfg market to China. It’s not if, it’s when they get here. \n",

Ask Kodak how it feels about its decision to ignore the digital revolution going on in the camera space. How print media feels about the internet. If you don’t adapt, you get left behind. If you cling to the old and ignore the new you are left with neither. Progress happens and it’s a bumpy road, but those bumps eventually get smoothed out. You might want to resist change but it’s gonna happen, just like it happened going from horse drawn carriages to the gas powered autos that we are so desperately trying to cling to today.\n",

However, let's understand that a majority of people voted for this government and their policies especially with regards for theri support of green initiatives.  Our homegrown auto companies bowed to government presssure while accepting billions in taxpayer monies to help support the push towards moving away from fossil fuels.  This transition was obviously not well thought out as our auto companies must contend with high labor costs with little in the way of productivity enhancements so they have to produce vehicles that provide them with some level of profit.  Even if they wanted to produce smaller EVs they cannot.  Combine that with little to any thought over the charging network and you have a recipe for disaster which we are currently witnessing.  Our government will continue to through money at the problem as that is really all they know how to do.  Good luck with that.\n",

When ICE cars were first introduced, only wealthy people could have them. Was that OK? Or should they have stopped all ICE car manufacturing early on. Maybe FORD could have been a success making something other than Model Ts, which made cars available to most Americans because of the cost changes. THAT, and continuing massive FOSSIL FUEL subsidies to that industry. They don't like to talk about that - the huge tax benefits and subsidies given the oil/gas industries. A bit more patience back then and looking the other way of corporate subsidies.  And if you want an ICE car, you can certainly buy one. As for individual car incentives, that's another discussion. But as for industry-wide subsidies for the ICE car and gas/oil industries - they have been a constant since the beginning. So, when you say the government involvement is bad - be ready to answer for all the huge subsidies and tax breaks that went to - maybe - your fave industry. Government doesn't do stuff on their own - usually lobbying by corporations is key to what gets done and how much of your money goes elsewhere. And corporations like it that way. So, let's be real.\n",

I'll always be pro gas, over electric. and I'm also not going to let a car drive its self with me in it. the mach E isnt a mustang either. mustang has never been a SUV. that's another reason people hate that pile of trash.\n",

My parents are blue color retirees who are raise on Lincoln’s Hemis,351 Cleveland’s and windsors. The kids follow suit,with Pontiac Corvette chargers n challenger. You fumble the ball like Tiki barber, kicked wide right like the Bills again…… youguys have history that repeats itself with generations. You only needed a small Ev division. Now my dad has a Tundra just to spite you cuz you broke his Heart History Legacy as. An who owned a F150 for work truck,a Denali as weekend ride and his Chevy avalanche he can’t part ways with. So much more that he got a new engine n transmission and paint job. Now he doesn’t give a crap about the big 3. And we’re loyal to you’re unreliable product because it kept the folks in D town working and it was joy in repairing your ride. Now you’re caddy’s n regals are imported from china. Yeah ok. Mercedes here I come this spring. Why should the AMERICAN tax payer stay loyal to the big 3 when over half of your product is produced in other countries????? Please answer the question\n",

            "Description: In August 2023, it took about twice as long to sell an EV in the U.S. as it did the previous January. Prices of EVs are down 22% year-over-year and that's mainly driven by Tesla. About two thirds of EVs sold are Elon Musk's brand. Companies like Ford have ramped up hybrid production as demand has leveled off. While slightly more than half of consumers say EVs are the future and will eventually replace Internal Combustion Engines, less than a third of dealers say so. This all comes at a time when investments in EVs are more than ever. So what's really going on? Watch the video to learn more.\n"
