No , but I think in 10 years, after this crap has worked it’s way through the comedy culture and trans people are as normal as being black , then I’ll bet for his legacy he will wish he had been cancelled. Think I’m wrong? Go back and watch Eddie Murphy in Raw and see how terribly some of that material has aged. Back then it was cool to attack and make fun of gays for being gay and supposedly “carrying AIDS on they lips “ and today that kind of comedy  is just sad. \\nEvery comedian has a moment in their career where they are no longer setting trends , they’re following them,  and if they are really self aware, and not egocentric they know when that moment is and they either change their material  and make it better with a great second act, as comedians like Carlin did, or they retire to save their legacy . Chappelle has blown right by that moment without the slightest recognition that he passed from trend setter to hack comedian looking for the establishment’s praise. Chappelle isn’t being subversive attacking trans people, there’s nothing cutting edge or insightful in repackaging the same old “ oh you identify as a women then I’ll identify as something absurd ” joke. Dude, we’ve heard it a thousand times, it wasn’t that funny the first 300 times we heard it, so what’s to make it funnier cause it comes out of Chappelle’s face over and over again? You can be funny making observations about issues like transgenderism but you are just a tired hack if you use that humor to go right at them like so many other “bro” comics do. \\nIf your defense of Chappelle is “he’s too rich to cancel he don’t care” then you miss the point and you inadvertently admit that he’s part of the establishment and the establishment isn’t challenging the status quo, he’s just reinforcing its ignorance. Chappelle, Gervais , Maher and a few others have aged out of the culture. They might have been insightful and cutting edge at one time but today, they are just sharing the same tired jokes trying to keep themselves relevant and liked by the largest audience they can and when you’re doing that it’s time for you to squeeze yourself into a gaudy white jumpsuit and get on the stage in Las Vegas and just play your hits cause you are not going to be doing anything new from here on out.

In this example, it is doubtful that ANYONE (including the Breakfast Club) would dismiss the attacks on Black people with \"He\\'s a comedian\".  I don\\'t think people know what \"cancelled\" means. Black people cancelled TF out of Anthony Richard (Kramer) after he used the N-Word.  That\\'s cancelled. J.K.  Rowling is a multimillionaire who is still selling books and releasing new books this year.  Dave Chappelle is a multimillionaire who just completed his 8th special for Netflix. Meanwhile Black transgender women, (who have ALWAYS existed) are being attacked on commuter trains while people watch (ATL) or beat up by a group of Black folks returning from a BLM march, or killed--most of the time by heterosexual men who had sex with them knowing full well who they were.  Give me abreak.  Having one trans friend doesn\\'t magically make someone less transphobic, same as having one white friend doesn\\'t magically make one not a racist.  No one is trying to cancel Dave.  People are responding to his own words, and now he\\'s trying to take that away be calling the reaction \"Cancel culture\".  I have watched all of his specials.  I watched this one.  There were funny moments...but then he seemed to focus on LGBT people with zero regard for how powerful his voice is and how it can be used by some to justify violence against my community.him  He can eat', 'like_count': '', 'reply_count': None}]}\n"
