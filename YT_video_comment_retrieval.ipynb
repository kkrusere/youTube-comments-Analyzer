I did what I want when I wanted I was by myself all the time did I like it, most of the part yes but there was times when my mind would get to me and id probably go grab a drink because I couldn't stand true to my medication but it got lonely tho. Now today two years later after I met her it's been and emotional rollercoaster like a dragon and a serpent fighting each other over control on who right wrong what ever I don't know if I'm in the right place right now where my life is I just wanted a girlfriend someone to call mine I didnt know it was gonna come to this, homelessness fighting argument getting beat ,beating...am I the good guy i thought i was before I met her. She cool she's protected me she's ,loved me?..meh.  I never really had a real girlfriend I don't know how to be there for someone else let alone myself. I do ask myself this how does she make me feel\\n\\nI feel like I'm with my Nan. I was abused growing up I was told this and that about myself destroying my self esteem, I'd get beat for the little of things id have to slave in the house with my little brother we doth had the Same thing happen to us I just had it worse. Id get made like a dumbass etc. through all abuse my Nan would still tell me she loves me. That's how my spouse makes me feel I feel disturbed with myself like I don't have a brain. \\n\\nBefore I met her I'll admit i thought of myself ALOT because it was just me just me I had no friends I had no family nothing and I was completely cool with it shit happens id tell myself. Jerking off going to the gym and making myself better in my time I may had been depressed but I was happy I had accepted loneliness I had accepted that I'll be alone then she pops up in my life out of no where. \\n\\n\\nI learned toxicity I can admit my faults because when I'm or feel crossed yea dude I stone wall I shut you out. I don't listen I can agree to that I listen to myself or someone I feel I could listen to. \\n\\nWe have bad communication skills we fight all the time then after..what make up I guess..I don't like it feels wrong it doesn't feel right to fight then say oh I love you this and that I feel like I'm being fake not being honest\\n\\n\\nDo I love her? She claims all the time she does. I really just wanna be alone I don't think relationship where my thing anyway I always told myself I wanna get myself tougher then the right one will show up for me the real girl the perfect girl. Someone that'll understand I'm just a road warrior a lone wonder someone that just be my friend. I don't feel like a friend lover etc everything just feels off unsettling within myself parts of me being taken my depression getting worse state of mind state of self. \\n\\nI know me I know who I am WHAT I AM. \\n\\nI'm iziah a king but I'm more then just a name I'm also a soul in a body. \\n\\nThere's lots I think I need to learn lots I need to maybe accept... that I'll be just miserable my life going no where unless I get help. I need help. \\n\\nI have wrongs to ive done things i wish I didn't do, like smacked her ...man i was raised better then that. \\n\\nI don't understand her most of the time one minute she'll all happy whenever then very angry and annoyed at me her feelings gets lashes out at me I try to shut up I try to be nice yet my brain it hurts then I get blamed for not being there when I've always tried and theres someone else being there for her I just wanna be left alone\",\n","        \"like_count\": \"\",\n","        \"reply_count\": null\n","    },\n","    {\n","        \"comment_text\": \"Never change beast.
